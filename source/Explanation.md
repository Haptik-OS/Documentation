# Explanation of the SDK's Scope and Applications

The `Haptikos SDK` is structured into three key components.

## Core
This foundational module includes the `Haptikos Player` and various interactive elements such as object grabbing, button pressing, and integrated interaction logic for application-wide use.

## Haptics
Allows users to design and implement custom haptic feedback effects tailored to specific virtual objects, supplemented by a library of pre-made haptic effects.

## Gestures
Facilitates controller-free navigation within applications, enhancing user experience through intuitive hand gestures.

The Core SDK provides all the necessary tools for setting up interactive scenes with Haptikos in Unity. It includes a comprehensive guide on integrating the Haptikos Player into new projects and detailed instructions on utilizing the various interaction elements available.
